Assuming you have saved the file with name unifying_pair.c, you can build using command

$ gcc -o unifying_pair unifying_pair.c
One more thing you need to know before pairing is the location of your device under /dev/. In my case it was /dev/hidraw2 (actually i couldn't manage to find the difference between hidraw0, hidraw1 and hidraw2 but i just tried them all).

Then become root (or use sudo, doesn't matter),

# ./unifying_pair /dev/hidraw2
